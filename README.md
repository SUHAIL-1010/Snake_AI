***Snake AI (PyTorch)***



This project is based on the original Snake AI implementation by **Patrick Loeber**.

It uses PyTorch and Deep Q-Learning to train an AI agent to play the Snake game.



ðŸ“Œ Features



Snake game built using Pygame.



AI agent trained using Deep Q-Learning (DQN).



Experience replay and exploration-exploitation tradeoff.



Visualization of training progress.
